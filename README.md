ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Steven, currently a Master's student in CS at University of Illinois. I develop several open source projects in my free time.

My current work/projects can be roughly split into 3 categories:
- Software Verification: This is the main topic of my Master's program, and I along with my colleagues developed [`verse`](https://github.com/crides/verse) for verifying decision logic in hybrid systems. I've also started to learn about ITPs like Coq and maybe there'll be projects from there.
- Human Input devices: I have my custom keyboards, for at-home use ([`fissure`](https://github.com/crides/fissure)) and portable use ([`fusion`](https://github.com/crides/fusion)). These are still mostly keyboards, but I'm slowly integrating pointing device into them. I've also developed the first open sourced embedded stenography engine Kolibri, and related stenography keyboards, both of which are in the [`steno`](https://github.com/crides/steno) repo. There are also custom keycaps ([`sqdg`](https://github.com/crides/sqdg)) and PCB libraries ([`kleeb`](https://github.com/crides/kleeb)). 
- Human automation: projects for (attempting to) automating and improving efficiency of my life. The main project is [`sched`](https://github.com/crides/sched), which aims to automate task/event scheduling. On the side there are [`zeub`](https://github.com/crides/zeub) and [`larm`](https://github.com/crides/larm) which try to provide an interface for automation.
